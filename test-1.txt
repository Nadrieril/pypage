Hi,
{{
    name = 'Bob'
    activity = 'skiing'
}}
How are you, {{name}}?
I heard you went {{activity}}.

Here is a nice pattern:
{% for x in [1,2,3] for y in ['a','b','c']  %}
{{x}} -> {{y}}{%%}

And here's an ode to you:
{{
    for vowel in 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u':
        write(vowel*5 + '\n')
}}
Best,
Alice

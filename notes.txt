pypage (Python Page Generator)
======

pypage lets you embed Python code easily and flexibly in documents (plain text, HTML, etc). 
Its syntax is similar templating languages like [Liquify]() and [Jinja]().

    The output is indented based on the second line's indentation.

- For loop tag


- While tag

~~~~~

strip all block tags appearing on lines by themselves
strip single line code tags
    
  i.e. If an opening delimiter is on a line by itself, strip away the newline before it.
       Same goes for the closing delimiter.

- Instead of write(), replace sys.stdout

- Provide the user with a function that escapes (non-HTML) text, optionally.
  For exampe, make set env['escape'] = cgi.escape, so that the user could {{ escape(...) }}

- Optional close tag in the form of "endtag"

- Optional stripping of the leading and/or trailing newline+whitespace before delimitedNodes

- Do not allow (i.e. strip out) invalid chars in for tag target list

- Handle user code errors gracefully

- Raise an error for 2 sec+ while loops.

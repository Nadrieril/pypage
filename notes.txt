- Indentation support (code & output)

    Take the output indent with `prefix` from the second line onwards.
    So just split the output on '\n' and re-join with (prefix + '\n')

    The second line of code determines indentation.
    All lines of code after the second must match its indentation or be empty.

- Optional stripping of the leading and/or trailing newline+whitespace before delimitedNodes

- Do not allow (i.e. strip out) invalid chars in for tag target list

- "while dofirst " alternative to do-while
- Print warning to stdout when a loop has taken more than 2 seconds.

pypage (Python Page Generator)
======

pypage lets you embed Python code easily and flexibly in documents (plain text, HTML, etc). 
Its syntax is similar templating languages like [Liquify]() and [Jinja]().



Features
--------

- Code tag

  - Intelligent Indentation Handling

    The second line of code determines indentation.
    All lines of code after the second must match its indentation or be empty.
    The output is indented based on the second line's indentation.

- Block tag

If a block tag is on a line by itself, surrounded only by whitespace, then that whitespace is 
automatically excluded from the output. This allows you indent your block tags without 
worrying about any excess whitespace floating around.

- Conditional (if, elif, else) tag


- For loop tag


- While tag

  - dofirst option
  - slow option


- Capture tag

- Include tag

- Comment tag

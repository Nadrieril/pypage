~~~~~

- Strip away newlines before or after a tag, if there is nothing but whitespace 
  between the newline and the delimiter. 
    
  i.e. If an opening delimiter is on a line by itself, strip away the newline before it.
       Same goes for the closing delimiter.

- Optional close tag in the form of "endtag"

- Optional stripping of the leading and/or trailing newline+whitespace before delimitedNodes

- Do not allow (i.e. strip out) invalid chars in for tag target list

- Handle user code errors gracefully

- Raise an error for 2 sec+ while loops.
